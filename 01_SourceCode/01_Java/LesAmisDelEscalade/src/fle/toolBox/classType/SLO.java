 *          Instead of type a class as follow :<br>
 *          public class x{@code<O extends Object>} for a O destinated to be a
 *          SLO<br>
 *          do the following : <br>
 *          public class x{@code<O extends SLO>} and so only SLO extended
 *          classes will be accepted
